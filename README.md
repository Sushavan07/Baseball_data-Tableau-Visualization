Summary
During the course of making this data visualization various Tableau techniques were used to represent Baseball data. Many relationships have been explored within the factors such as Batting Average and Height and Weight. A new variable i.e Height/Weight ratio was used to explore new insights. In conclusion, it was found that a player weighing aproximatly 180 pounds and having height of 72 to 74 inches is predicted to perform better than other players in the same set of circumstances, without any effect of left or right handedness of the player.
